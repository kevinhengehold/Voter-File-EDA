# Voter-File-EDA
Takes a voter file from the Ohio SOS website, then:

•	Calculates Age of each voter, purge improbably old records
•	Compares histograms of age by party affiliation
•	Examines state representative districts, see if the party with the most registered voters won the given seat
•	Plots number of democrat, republican, and unaffiliated voters who voted in each general election since 2000.  
•	Uses machine learning algorithms (logistic regression, random forest classifier) to predict likelihood of a person voting in the 2016 general election based on their gender, party affiliation, age, and how often they voted in the last four elections (2012 general and primary, 2014 general and primary).
